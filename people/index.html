				<h1>Meet The Bush Farm Family</h1>
				<section class="text-paragraph">
					Farming is a family pursuit at Bush Farm with a heritage of cattle breeding going back over a century. Nano and Pappi both come from families who have achieved distinctions at Show events throughout the country down through the years. Together they have built a renowned stock of Angus and Charolais animals who are sought after beef and dairy farmers alike. Children and grandchildren all play a roll on the farm and formed close bonds through farming.<br><br>
